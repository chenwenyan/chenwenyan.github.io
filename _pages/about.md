<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Greetings! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Hyperscale Systems and Cloud Architecture Lab at Nanyang Technological University, working with [Prof. Dmitrii Ustiugov](https://ustiugov.github.io/). Previously, I was a PhD student at the Cloud and Distributed Systems (CDS) Lab at University of Macau (2021.08-2025.08), co-supervised by [Prof. Huanle Xu (徐欢乐)](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/huanlexu/) and [Prof. Kejiang Ye (叶可江)](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~kejiang?language=en).
